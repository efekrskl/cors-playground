# CORS playground

This is a simple playground to experiment with Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies in web development. 
It includes a basic server and client setup to demonstrate how CORS works and how to configure it.
Go through different requests and see how CORS headers affect the responses.

Live Demo: [CORS Playground](https://cors-playground-client.pages.dev/)

## Project Structure
- `server/`: Contains the Express.js server code that handles CORS requests.
